Please check "Use folder names." when you extract files (Using Winzip) or use /d option with PKZip because all the path in the INI files are set to C:\QB directory.
If you extract it in a different directory, set new paths in 
Help>Set Paths from the Basic menu.

<-- Other Basic versions and many other compilers and files are available
